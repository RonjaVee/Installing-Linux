## Installing process

After some research ([Debian manuals](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/choosing.en.html)), I chose the stable version of the Debian distributions that were available as I'm a new user and I'm mainly going to use this machine on school work and not looking to bump into strange bugs or other confusing situations. If the software is too outdated I just need to work around that later. My hardware shouldn't be too new as this laptop was bought somewhere around 2015.

It took some time to decide which desktop to choose.
