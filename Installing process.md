## Installing process

### Some research and decisions before installing

After some research ([Debian manuals](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/choosing.en.html)), I chose the stable version of the Debian distributions that were available as I'm a new user and I'm mainly going to use this machine on school work and not looking to bump into strange bugs or other confusing situations. If the software is too outdated I just need to work around that later. My hardware shouldn't be too new as this laptop was bought somewhere around 2015.

It took some time to decide which desktop to choose. I checked out [Debian user from](https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=156498) as well as watched plenty of videos on Debian, most of which mentioned a preferred desktop. Cinnamon seemed the easiest to approach so I decided to go with that. None of the options shouldn't be too heavy for my hardware.

I needed a flash drive, so I walked to the nearest department store and picked up a Maxwell 32 GB dual USB drive with USB-C and USB 3.0 connectors.
